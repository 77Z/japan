          DAY ONE      
        <p>
          When I was coming on the plane I think a main question is what are great tourist attractions in japan? We arive at the Kiyomizu-dera which holds a very stange tradition, 
            in Japan Kannon the god of mercy is a beleif people go to this shrine, before the law was changed in 1864 people would do this thing called "taking the plunge" which is a very advanced form of wish making pretty much you jump from the 
           13 meter building, and don't die. If your put life of the hands of kannon and jump, you will be granted a wish! Unless you don't die (Because kannon doesn't give wishes to corpses) According to the manuscript, 234 people jumped from the stage of Kiyomizu.
            A woman tried to jump even twice. Survival rate was about 85% (34 people died). After visting the shrine we go to the Shiono (塩野) in Akasaka which serves Mochi.Mochi is Japanese rice cake made of mochigome, a short-grain japonica glutinous rice, and sometimes other ingredients  
            such as water, sugar, and cornstarch. The rice is pounded into paste and molded into the desired shape. Then we head down the streets of Dōtonbori a poular street know for it's food, shops and theater! Stop at a restaurant and crash into bed.
